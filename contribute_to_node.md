## Want to contribute to Node.js but don't know where to start?

Welcome! You've come to the right place. You can jump right in by going to the working group guides below. You can accelerate getting started in any of these working groups by being introduced to a member of the working group who is knowledgable in the work you'd like to tackle. Context to approaching problems is important and these introductions can save you time working on something the collaborators have already tackled. If you'd like an introduction, [file an issue](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started/issues) with 
- what you'd like to work on or the challenge you're facing
- the working group(if known)  

and we'll label your request as `intro requested`. A collaborator will facilitate this for you.

### Group contributing guides
- [Website WG](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#nodejs-community-contributing-guide-10)  
  The Website Working Group is primarily concerned with the code and overall structure of the [Node.js](nodejs.org) website.
- [Docs WG](https://github.com/nodejs/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  This group serves as a central place for Node.js documentation coordination, but not documentation itself. They will help get you there.   
- [HTTP2](https://github.com/nodejs/http2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)  
  This repository focuses on an HTTP/2 implementation for Node.js Core
- [citgm](https://github.com/nodejs/citgm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-changes-to-citgm)  
  citgm is a tool for pulling down an arbitrary module from npm and testing it using a specific version of the node runtime.  The Node.js project uses citgm to smoketest releases and controversial changes.
- [Diagnostics WG](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics#diagnostics-working-group)  
  Diagnostics ensure Node provides a set of comprehensive, documented, extensible diagnostic protocols, formats, and APIs to enable tool vendors to provide reliable diagnostic tools for Node including tracing, profiling, heap and memory analysis, and step debugging.
- [Community Committee](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#nodejs-community-contributing-guide-10)  
  The Community Committee tackles challenges within the Node.js project that require the many roles outside of code contribution vital to sustaining a healthy open source project.
- [Node.js Collection](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-collection#the-nodejs-collection-team)
  A place for the Node.js Collection to organize the technical editing process for articles submitted to the publication.
- [Evangelism WG](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism#evangelism)  
  The Evangelism WG creates promotional materials, brings discussions to a wider audience, and attemps to grow the community through positive, supportive messaging.
