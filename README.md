 ## Help
 If you're looking for help while writing Node.js, ask questions in the Node.js [Help](https://github.com/nodejs/help#create-a-new-issue) repository. No question is too small!
 
 When looking for help, search for your question in these venues:
 
 * [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org)
 * [Node.js Help](https://github.com/nodejs/help)
 * [Open or closed issues in the related Node.js GitHub organization repository](https://github.com/nodejs)
 * [Questions tagged 'node.js' on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node.js)

### Contributing
*Want to write a document?*

Please contribute! Check out our existing documents in this repository to improve existing resources, and look at [issues](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started/issues) to discover resources people would love to learn from but don't yet exist. To get started, you have to [fork](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started/fork) this repo to your own GitHub account first.

*Please try to write documentation that prioritizes the LTS version.* Keeping work updated is ideal but understandably tough.

If you want to submit a new feature or a bugfix, the best way is to create the changes in a separate branch, e.g.: `git checkout -b feature/mycoolfeature`. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request and get your contribution merged.
